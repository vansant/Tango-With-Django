# Design Assumptions
1. Python 2.x to follow along 
2. There is a one-to-many relationship between the category and page tables meaning each category can have many pages and each page belongs to one category.

# Setup (Ubuntu 14.04)
1. Install python-dev on Ubuntu - needed to compile and install Pillow
    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev
2. Install virutalenv
    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
